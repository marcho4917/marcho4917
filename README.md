## About me
I am self-taught software tester who constantly wants to develop. I always care about high quality and every detail of my tasks. During my training process, I have mastered the skills of exploratory testing, testing of websites,  REST API testing, writing test cases, reporting defects. When I was learning with my programming mentor from Devs-Mentoring, I mastered the basics of python quite strongly. My plan for the future is to master test automation.
